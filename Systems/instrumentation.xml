instrumentation.xml

PA-18 instrumentation configuration. This file selects the
instrumentation modules that should be available.

You can have several instances of the same instrument type.
The value inside the name tag becomes the node in the property tree.
If two instruments have the same name you must use the number tag
to separate them. They become name[number] in the property tree.
Some instruments have additional configuration tags like static-port
and pitot-port. The static- and pitot-ports (and any other system that
an instrument depend on) have to be configured in the systems
configuration file: generic-systems.xml

The values in this file are the default values. If any configuration
tags are omitted in an aircraft specific version of this configuration
file, these values will be used (they are hardcoded).
